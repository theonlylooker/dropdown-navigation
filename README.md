- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What i learned

In this proyect i was mayorly focused in css, the list of things i learned was.

- Modals
- Styled Components

#### Modals

I have seen modals, but i never tried working on one myself, so it was a first time, i am sure there are a lot to be improved with it.

#### Styled Components

I knew about the Styled Components and how this makes components have css embedded inside. Makes easy to model a simple UI component instead of have more css inside index.css, and you can focus on style the component, making it more reusable

### Continued development

- I want to focus more on styled components, i didn't use it here but the creating a personalized theme as i read can make things more easy,
- I did use css flex, but i was having dificulties trying to move certaing objects to be perfect, so i want to get more comfortable with css flex as well as learning more about css grid
- Another things i want to reinforce is about positioning on css

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://medium.com/building-crowdriff/styled-components-to-use-or-not-to-use-a6bb4a7ffc21) - Here i found a discussion about the use of styled components.
- [Example resource 2](https://dev.to/elijahtrillionz/complete-guide-on-how-to-use-styled-components-in-react-360c) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand styled components. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
